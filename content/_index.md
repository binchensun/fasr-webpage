        The **Frequency Agile Solar Radiotelescope (FASR)** is a next generation radio interferometer array dedicated to solar and space weather research. FASR will build upon the technology that enabled the [Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array](https://ovsa.njit.edu/), but with 10 times more antennas and an order of magnitude wider bandwidth, it will bring the transformative technique of "ultrawide-band radio camera" to solar and heliospheric studies.
